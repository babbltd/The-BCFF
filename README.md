BCFF complies with all aspecits of the current (4.0) specification as approved by the IETF.
The purpose of BCFF is to support object-oriented programming using vCard capabilities and rules.
A file saved in the BCFF style can be universally loaded into programs such as Address Books, offering users rich experiences when searching and viewing records of contacts (people, organizations, groups, locations etc).
Use of BCFF by Mobile Operating Systems across applications is the use case shaping the Format.
